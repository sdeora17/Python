A mutuable object allows the programmer to modify its internal state after creation

An immutable object does not allow the programmer to change its state once it is created.

Immutable Objects are common in functional programming while mutuable objects are widely used in objected oriented programming.

Since Python is a multiparadigm programming language, it provides mutuable and immutable objects.

In Python, Everything is an object
Every Python Object has three core characteristics.

1. Values
2. Identity
3. Type

An object's value lies in a concrete position or address in a computer's memory.

The specific memory address is the Identity of an object


The Type of the object determine which class that object derives from.

An object's type define the operations that you can perform with or on that object





An object that allows the programmer to changes it's value without changing its Identity is a mutuable objects

Changes that can be performed on a mutuable object's Value are known as mutuations
